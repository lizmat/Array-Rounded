=head1 NAME

Array::Rounded - arrays that round indices while accessing elements

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Array::Rounded;

my @a is Rounded = ^10;
say @a[1.5];  # 2

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Array::Rounded provides a subclass of C<Array> called C<Rounded> that
will B<round> non-integer indices on the array, rather than truncating
them.  Other than that, any arrays created with the C<Rounded> class
will act as a normal C<Array>.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Because C<postcircumfix:<[ ]>> already intifies any non-integer value
in current and possibly future versions of the Raku Programming Language,
this module also exports some C<postcircumfix:<[ ]>> candidates to
circumvent the premature intifications.

Also, due to some issues with native arrays, it has as yet been
impossible to provide similar functionality for native arrays.
