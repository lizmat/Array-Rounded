NAME
====

Array::Rounded - arrays that round indices while accessing elements

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Array::Rounded;

my @a is Rounded = ^10;
say @a[1.5];  # 2
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

Array::Rounded provides a subclass of `Array` called `Rounded` that will **round** non-integer indices on the array, rather than truncating them. Other than that, any arrays created with the `Rounded` class will act as a normal `Array`.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
======================

Because `postcircumfix:<[ ]>` already intifies any non-integer value in current and possibly future versions of the Raku Programming Language, this module also exports some `postcircumfix:<[ ]>` candidates to circumvent the premature intifications.

Also, due to some issues with native arrays, it has as yet been impossible to provide similar functionality for native arrays.
